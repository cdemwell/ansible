Homepage and documentation source for Ansible
=============================================

This project hosts the source behind [ansibleworks.com/docs](http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/)

Contributions to the documentation are welcome.  To make changes, submit a pull request
that changes the reStructuredText files in the "rst/" directory only, and Michael can
do a docs build and push the static files. If you wish to verify output from the markup
such as link references, you may [install Sphinx] and build the documentation by running
`make viewdocs` from the `ansible/docsite` directory.  To include module documentation
you'll need to run `make webdocs` at the top level of the repository.  The generated
html files are in docsite/htmlout/ and really won't be formatted right until up
on ansibleworks.com.

If you do not want to learn the reStructuredText format, you can also [file issues] about
documentation problems on the Ansible GitHub project.

Note that module documentation can actually be [generated from a DOCUMENTATION docstring][module-docs]
in the modules directory, so corrections to modules written as such need to be made
in the module source, rather than in docsite source.
